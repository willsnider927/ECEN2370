 * @brief
 *   BLE Test performs two functions.  First, it is a Test Driven Development
 *   routine to verify that the LEUART is correctly configured to communicate
 *   with the BLE HM-18 module.  Second, the input argument passed to this
 *   function will be written into the BLE module and become the new name
 *   advertised by the module while it is looking to pair.
 *
 * @details
 * 	 This global function will use polling functions provided by the LEUART
 * 	 driver for both transmit and receive to validate communications with
 * 	 the HM-18 BLE module.  For the assignment, the communication with the
 * 	 BLE module must use low energy design principles of being an interrupt
 * 	 driven state machine.
 *
 * @note
 *   For this test to run to completion, the phone most not be paired with
 *   the BLE module.  In addition for the name to be stored into the module
 *   a breakpoint must be placed at the end of the test routine and stopped
 *   at this breakpoint while in the debugger for a minimum of 5 seconds.
 *
 * @param[in] *mod_name
 *   The name that will be written to the HM-18 BLE module to identify it
 *   while it is advertising over Bluetooth Low Energy.
 *
 * @return
 *   Returns bool true if successfully passed through the tests in this
 *   function.

	// This test will limit the test to the proper setup of the LEUART
	// peripheral, routing of the signals to the proper pins, pin
	// configuration, and transmit/reception verification.  The test
	// will communicate with the BLE module using polling routines
	// instead of interrupts.
	// How is polling different than using interrupts?
	// ANSWER: Polling requires the CPU to continuously check for an event, while interrupts allow the CPU to react to the event occurring.
	// How does interrupts benefit the system for low energy operation?
	// ANSWER: The system can sleep or go into a lower energy mode until an event occurs.
	// How does interrupts benefit the system that has multiple tasks?
	// ANSWER: Interrupts allow the system to switch focus between tasks when different events occur. This allows the system to seem like it is doing multiple tasks at once.
